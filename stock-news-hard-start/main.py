## STEP 1: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
# HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday. Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
# HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yerstday's closing stock price.

stock_parameters = {
    "function": "TIME_SERIES_DAILY",

increment = float(yesterday_closing_price) * 0.05

if difference >= increment:
    print("Get News")
    print(difference)
    print(increment)



## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/everything
# Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME. 
# HINT 1: Think about using the Python Slice Operator

news_response.raise_for_status()
news_data = news_response.json()



## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
# Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number. 
# HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.

# Twilio Example
# account_sid = os.environ["Twilio_account_sid"]

# Find your Account SID and Auth Token at twilio.com/console
# and set the environment variables. See http://twil.io/secure
# account_sid = os.environ['TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID']
# auth_token = os.environ['TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN']
# client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)
#
# message = client.messages.create(
#                               body='Hi there',
#                               from_='+15017122661',
#                               to='+15558675310'
#                           )
#
# print(message.sid)

first_three_articles = news_data["articles"][:3]
news_list = [f'Headline:{html.unescape(article["title"])} Brief:{html.unescape(article["description"])}' for article in first_three_articles]
print(news_list)

# Send each article as a separate message via Twilio
# client = Client(TWILIO_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN)

# Send each article as a separate message
# for news in news_list:
#     message = client.message.create(body=news,
#                                     from_="+15017122661",
#                                     to="Your number")

# Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
"""
